Instructions:  

Using the files contained in this zip file, implement solutions for the questions below.  Each question has a folder associated with it
containing the file where you will write your code, and a second file that contains the Jasmine tests relevant to that question.
               
Question folders are as follows:
1. sorting
2. stack
3. linked-list

All tests can be run by opening test.html in your browser.  If you want to comment out some tests to make it easier to focus on the question that you are
working on, you are more than welcome to do so.  Other than commenting, do not modify the tests in any way.

1.  Using the selection sort algorithm, write a function called 'sort' that takes an array of numbers and 
    returns a array of numbers sorted in ascending order.

    Selection Sort: 
     
    The algorithm finds the minimum value, swaps it with the value in the first position, and repeats these steps for the remainder of the list.


    Example:  function sort([3, 5, 1, 7, 5]) ==> [1, 3, 5, 5, 7]


2.  Implement the Stack data structure so that all tests pass.


3.  Implement the insert and remove methods of a linked list so that all tests pass.
